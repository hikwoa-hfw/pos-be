## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/danielreinhard1129/express-prisma-boilerplate.git
   cd express-prisma-boilerplate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```sh
   npx prisma db push
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:admin@localhost:6543/postgres"
PORT=8000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
MAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

## Scripts

- `build`: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript.
- `start`: Start the application.
- `dev`: Start the application in development mode with hot reloading.
- `test:integration`: Run integration tests.
- `test:unit`: Run unit tests.

## Testing

### Prerequisite

Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. The tests use a separate Docker container for the database to avoid affecting your development database.

Before running the tests, bring up the required Docker containers:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Then, to run the integration tests, use the following command:

```sh
npm run test:integration
```

This will execute the integration tests with the database running in a separate container.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests do not require Docker or a running database because dependencies are mocked using Dependency Injection (DI).

To run the unit tests, use:

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Explanation:

- **`docker compose up -d`**: This command will start your Docker containers in the background (`-d` stands for detached mode).
- **`npm run test:integration`**: This command runs your integration tests after the database containers are up and running.

- **`npm run test:unit`**: Executes unit tests with mocked services, faster and without external dependencies.
